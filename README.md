## Projects

* **CLARA:** CLARA, cognitive-based long & short-term memory with augmented retrieval artificial intelligence, is a cognitive agentic system aimed at allowing LLM to process information regarding memories and emotions similar to how humans do. The code for this project is not open-sourced yet, and the paper is expected to be published in 2024.

* **Multi-Agent-Collaboration: Slider Generator:** A 7-agent system including a researcher, slider planner, and a presenter team that will take a prompt as an input and work together to generate a multi-slide voice-over video presentation on the topic. MAC-Slide generator uses OpenAI models and the LangGraph framework.

* **Vox Strider:** A self-balancing self-driving bipedal robot controlled by multimodal large language models with text-to-speech and speech-to-text interface powered by OpenAI. Using natural language speech, the objective is set for the robot, and then using interval snapshots and visual LLM the instructions are created and executed by the robot.

* **Night-City:** A 3D futuristic cyberpunk-themed interactive city filled with easter eggs and references to the developer's life in Night City. The game engine behind Night City was developed using a 3D renderer (ThreeJS), a physics engine (Rapier), and thousands of lines of code in TypeScript. The models were created using the 3D software blender.

* **Echo-Search:** Echo Search is a feature-rich and powerful desktop application that allows you to search for a specific text or regular expression query in the content of files or for the file names within a directory and its subdirectories. It also offers the ability to replace the found text with another string of your choice or even open the file in the built-in code editor, so you can perform quick tweaks and updates. With its wide range of options and capabilities, it is an ideal solution for software developers, data analysts, and anyone looking for an efficient way to search and replace text in files. It is also a great tool for searching for files with specific names within a directory and its subdirectories.
